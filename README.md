# This was Paris in 1970

_This was Paris in 1970_ is a project by the [MIT Programs in Digital Humanities](https://digitalhumanities.mit.edu) in
 collaboration with our Fall 2020 Faculty Fellow, [Catherine Clark](https://history.mit.edu/people/catherine-clark),
 Associate Professor of History and French Studies at MIT.

The project will focus on the analysis of photographs of Paris in May 1970 taken by the
some 15,000 amateur photographers who participated in the photo contest “C’était Paris en
1970” or “This was Paris in 1970.” The project aims to consider both what these photographers
captured (what Paris looked like) and how they saw it. Even though the project looks at a subset
of the contest’s 100,000 submissions, it is still impossible to carry out a complete analysis of
content or form by hand. Therefore, this project will make use of Machine Learning techniques,
such as Neural Networks, Bayesian Networks, and Support Vector Machines to recognize
patterns that will assist in answering questions like: How do pictures influence the production of
new forms of knowledge? What is their role in representing the world?
